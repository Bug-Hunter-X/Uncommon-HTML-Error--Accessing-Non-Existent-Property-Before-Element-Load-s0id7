This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML error that arises from accessing a property of an element before the element has been fully loaded into the DOM.  The script attempts to set a non-existent property of a div element, but this action might fail if the script executes before the DOM is fully parsed.  The solution demonstrates a proper way to handle this scenario using event listeners and ensuring the element is loaded before attempting access.
